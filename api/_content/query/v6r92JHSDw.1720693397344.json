The public key is published in the domain's DNS records, and receiving servers can use that key to decode the signature. DKIM verification helps the receiving servers confirm the mail is really coming from your domain and not someone spoofing your domain."}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"question","depth":2,"text":"Question"},{"id":"answer","depth":2,"text":"Answer"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:Frequently Asked Questions:Frequently Asked Questions:1000303616.md","_source":"content","_file":"Frequently Asked Questions/Frequently Asked Questions/1000303616.md","_stem":"Frequently Asked Questions/Frequently Asked Questions/1000303616","_extension":"md"}
