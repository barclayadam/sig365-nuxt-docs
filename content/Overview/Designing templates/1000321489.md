We have a beta version for support with vCards available which you can access: [Here](https://app.signature365.com/settings/vCards) (this will be available on the menu in the very near future).

With a combination of both of these features, you can automatically generate a QR Code to link to the users vCard using the following value in the text field for the QR Code: {{vcardurl}}
