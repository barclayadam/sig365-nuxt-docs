Signature 365 can apply signatures to all email except the following:

*   Automatic replies (also known as out-of-office replies)
*   Appointments (including meeting invites)

In respect of encrypted and digitally signed emails:

*   **Client-side signatures are supported.** Signatures are added to email before email is encrypted or digitally signed.
*   **Server-side signatures are not supported.** The email flow remains the same. Encrypted or digitally signed email will flow via the Signature 365 service, but no signatures will be added. When using both server-side and client-side signatures, email with a client-side signature added by the Signature add-in for Outlook will not flow via the Signature 365 service.
