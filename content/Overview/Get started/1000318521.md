*   

By default you should select **Migrate to Signature 365 -** if issues are encountered with the migration process, you may be asked to use the **Export to Zip File** function by the support team at Symprex, although this process will take longer due to the manual process.

*   

Select the tickboxes to choose the templates that you wish to migrate. You can use the **Select In Use** buttons to only select templates that are currently in use by Email Signature Manager, or select / deselect all templates. Click Validate to check the existing template code.

*   

The validation page will detail if any issues are detected in your templates. Click the Validation Result to see information about any errors.

*   

The results page will detail the error(s) found in the template, and if these are recoverable. In the case below, the template contains a user-created AD attribute and shows how this will be converted. This will complete migration but will require manual changes to the uploaded template on Signature 365.

*   

Any templates with errors will be deselected - if the error is recoverable, you can select the template to upload even if validation has failed. Click **Migrate** to start the migration process.

*   

The next step will take you through the standard Signature 365 login process to authenticate with your tenant - **Please note this is your Signature 365 login details, unless your account authenticates with SSO to Microsoft 365.**

*   

The migration process will now upload the selected templates to Signature 365. If you are attempting to overwrite existing templates, you will see an **Overwrite Confirmation** box to confirm you wish to do this - select the tickbox for a template to confirm.
