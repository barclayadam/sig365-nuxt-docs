The Signature 365 Agent for Outlook supports adding signatures to email so signatures appear directly below the email being composed, and for users to select an alternative signature if additional signatures have been assigned to them.

The Signature 365 Agent is available to use with Outlook 2016 / 2019 / 2021, and can be deployed using MSI or ClickOnce.
