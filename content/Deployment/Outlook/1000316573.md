## Issue

You have installed Signature 365 and wish to prevent users on your domain from creating their own internal Outlook signatures or wish to disable the internal signature functionality of Outlook completely.

You may also wish to remove any existing signatures that your users have created or have been deployed by another solution within the internal Outlook signatures feature.

## Solution

#### Info

This solution is for Windows Server 2012R2 and later versions.
:::

You can use the Symprex Email Signature Utility to perform both of these functions - please see the following [Link](https://support.signature365.com/en/support/solutions/articles/1000318073-how-to-set-outlook-default-fonts-for-all-users) for information on how to achieve this.
