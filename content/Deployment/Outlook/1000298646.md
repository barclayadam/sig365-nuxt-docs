The Signature 365 add-in for Outlook allows users to preview signatures, add signatures to emails so they appear directly below the email being composed, and select an alternative signature if additional signatures have been assigned to them.

:::info

The Outlook Add-in is only supported for Outlook 365 subscription versions due to limitations from Microsoft.  

If you are using perpetually licenced versions of Outlook (2016 / 2019 / 2021) you will need to use the Outlook Agent following the instructions here: [How to install the Outlook (Classic) agent](https://support.signature365.com/support/solutions/articles/1000305027-how-to-install-the-outlook-classic-agent)
:::

The add-in can be deployed from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to apply to users, groups or your entire organisation, or it can be installed from the "Get Add-ins" option in Office 365 for individual users or testing purposes.  

Please note that the Outlook Add-in **must** be deployed to your users using one of the methods below. If the add-in is installed manually by a user from the Add-in store, it will be unable to insert signatures due to a security limitation imposed by Microsoft.

:::warning
#### Important

If you select the **Specific users/groups** option, Microsoft 365 will only deploy the add-in to users that are direct members of any groups you specify. Members of any nested groups will not be included. This is a limitation of Microsoft 365.

The following screen will be displayed, when both apps show as **Completed**, click **Done**.

#### Important

The add-in may not be available to all users immediately. The deployment usually only takes a few minutes but can take up to 6 hours according to Microsoft. For some users the add-in may not be available until Outlook has been restarted.

Click **Done** to close the add-in pane.

The Outlook add-in is now visible in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and will deploy to your selected users.
