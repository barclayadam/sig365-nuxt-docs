## Scenario

Follwing the integration of Signature 365 to your Microsoft 365 tenant, you see a number of new applications listed in your Azure / Entra ID **Enterprise applications** list.  

You wish to know which of these applications are required.

## Reason

Signature 365 configures the **Signature 365**, **Signature 365 Setup** and **Signature 365 Sent Items Update** applications as part of the initial integration to grant access to different parts of your tenant.  

Depending on the features enabled, you will see differing applications listed.
