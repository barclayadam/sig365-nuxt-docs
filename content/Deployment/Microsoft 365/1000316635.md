title: 'Restrict access to Signature 365 server-side signatures using an Office 365 Security group'
category: 'Deployment'
folder: 'Microsoft 365'

## Scenario

You wish to restrict usage of the Signature 365 server-side signatures function to a specific subset of your user base.

## Solution

You can create a mail-enabled security group in Exchange Online to limit access to Signature 365 and the users that are imported. This can also be used for existing configurations to update the transport rule within Office 365 to only route email from a specified group for server-side injection.

#### Info

You will need Administrative access to your company's Office 365 Tenant to complete this task

## Create a new security group in Office 365

Log on to the [Exchange Admin Centre](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/)

Select the **Groups** menu item:

Select the **Mail-enabled Security Group** option, and click **Add a group**:

Select **Mail-enabled security** as the group type:

Name and describe your new group - we suggest the example below:

You will need to assign an owner for the group:

Add the members you wish to grant access to Signature 365 here:

Give the group an email address. We strongly recommend enabling the **Require owner approval to join the group** option to prevent users joining the group and routing through Signature 365:

## Modify the Transport rule to only apply to members of this group

:::info
#### Info

The changes below are only required to update an existing configuration - if you are configuring Signature 365 for the first time this is not required
:::

We can now modify the Transport rule to restrict access to this group of users.

From the 365 Menu, expand the **Mail flow** dropdown, and select **Rules:**

From the list of rules, select the **Send to Signature 365 for signature injection** rule:

Select the **Edit rule conditions** option from the pop-out menu:

Find the **Apply this rule if** option, and hit the **+**icon

This will add create an **And** component to the rule. Select **The sender** and **Is a member of this group**.
