Signature 365 can update emails in Sent Items with the signature that was added server-side after email was sent. Two modes for updating sent items are available:

*   Update sent item with signature
*   Copy sent item and update copy with signature

Enabling the Sent Items update feature means sent items will show the exact email received by recipients.

## Enabling Sent Items update

Go to **Integrations**:

Click **Enable** for the **Sent items update** feature. You will be asked to confirm you want to enable the Sent Items Update feature. After confirming you need to sign to Microsoft 365 using Global administrator credentials to grant consent to the required permissions (**Read and write mail in all mailboxes** and **Sign in and read user profile**).

The Sent Items Update feature will now be enabled and working:

When mode is **Copy sent item with signature**, then sent item will be updated in-place with the signature content that was added to the email.

When mode is **Copy sent items and update copy with signature**, the subject is prefixed with [Signature Copy] to be easy to identify, search for and manage.

## Change Sent Items update mode

You can change the Sent Items update mode at any time. Click **Settings** for the **Sent items update** feature to open the **Sent items update settings** dialog.

Select your preferred mode:

*   Update sent item with signature
*   Copy sent item and update copy with signature

Click **Save** to save the new setting.

Note the new setting may take up to 5 minutes to become active.
