## Create a new security group in Office 365

Log on to the [Exchange Admin Centre](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/)

Select the **Groups** menu item:

Select the **Mail-enabled Security Group** option, and click **Add a group**:

Select **Mail-enabled security** as the group type:

Name and describe your new group - we suggest the example below:

You will need to assign an owner for the group:

Add the members you wish to exclude from Signature 365 here:

Give the group an email address. We also suggest enabling the **Require owner approval to join the group** option to prevent users joining the group accidentally:

Review the settings and click on **Create group:**

## Modify the Transport rule to exclude the new group

We can now add this group to the Transport rule, to ensure they are excluded.

From the 365 Menu, expand the **Mail flow** dropdown, and select **Rules:**

From the list of rules, select the **Send to Signature 365 for signature injection** rule:

Select the **Edit rule conditions** option from the pop-out menu:

Update the **Except if** drop down to **The sender** and **is a member of this group**.

Hit the **+** icon, and select the group you just created:

Hit the save button on the rule, this is now completed.
