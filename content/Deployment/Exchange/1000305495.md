## Problem

You wish to use Signature 365 to deploy signatures to the on-premise Exchange component of your hybrid Exchange / Office 365 configuration.

## Solution

The Signature 365 Exchange Agent allows you to add signatures to your on-premise Exchange mailboxes in the same way as the Signature 365 service for Microsoft 365.

You can download the agent from the followingÂ [link](https://downloads.signature365.com/exchange/Signature_365_Exchange_Agent_1.0.3_Setup.exe).

The software will need to be installed on your on-premise exchange server. The installation process will request the Exchange transport service to be restarted to allow integration. If this is denied the server will require rebooting before the agent can function.

Once installed, you will need to generate a secret key to integrate with Signature 365. Log on to Signature 365 and go to **Integrations** and click **Enable** on the [**Exchange**](https://app.signature365.com/integrations/exchange-agent) option.

Click **Enable** on the following screen.

When the secret has generated, click **Copy** to copy this to your clipboard, and then click **Next** to finish the process.

Return to the server where you have installed the Exchange agent, and paste the secret key into the configuration dialog. Click **Test Connection** to test the link to Signature 365.
