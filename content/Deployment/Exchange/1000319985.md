*   You will be prompted to configure the SPF records for your mail domains. It is important that this is completed to ensure that mail routed through the Signature 365 servers is not marked as spam by your recipients.  

When you are happy this is completed, click next to continue. It can take time for your provider's DNS configuration to propagate

*   If using the automated setup, click **Authorise** to sign in to Microsoft 365
*   The setup process will create the required Inbound and Outbound Connectors and a Transport Rule to enable server-side injection with the settings you have specified. When this completes, hit **Next**
