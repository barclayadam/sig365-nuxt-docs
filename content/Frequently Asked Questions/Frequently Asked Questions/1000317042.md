## Problem

When received by some web mail applications such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail, images for signatures are displayed as attachments to the email, and are not part of a signature.

## Reason

There are a number of known issues with displaying embedded images in web-based email clients. If you encounter this issue, please check that the signature images display correctly whilst using the Outlook desktop client, OWA or the Outlook app on iOS / android devices.

Due to the various methods that mail clients use to display or attach images included in emails, we are unable to troubleshoot this problem when it occurs with an external webmail service.

If you experience an issue where this problem is also experienced in a desktop app or Outlook mobile client, please raise a ticket with the Support team by emailing support@symprex.com, or by using www.symprex.com/support/
