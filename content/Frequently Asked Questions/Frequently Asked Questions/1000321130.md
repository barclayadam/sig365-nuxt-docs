## Scenario

You wish to understand which ports and URLs are required for the Signature 365 web portal, add-in and agent to function.

## Solution

All Signature 365 services connect via port 443, using TLS 1.2 or higher.  

We recommend allowing *.signature365.com to account for any future additions or changes to the configuration requirements.  

Where [region] is listed, this should be replaced with your Signature 365 region code.
