## Scenario

You wish to update the group that is assigned to receive server-side injection within Signature 365.

## Solution

The security group can be updated in either of 2 methods, both of which are detailed below.  

If you wish to apply the rule to multiple groups, it is only possible to configure this through the Exchange Admin center.  

Please note that if these groups are updated within the exchange admin centre, this change will not be reflected in the Signature 365 portal.

To update this group using Signature 365, use the following link:  

[Signature 365](https://app.signature365.com/integrations/microsoft365/setup/exchange)

This will take you through the exchange setup process and allow you to update the group selected, or apply server-side signatures to all users.
