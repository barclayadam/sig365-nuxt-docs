This completes the process of removing the SIS connectors and rules from your Exchange Online tenant.

### ESM Agent

Signagent should ideally be removed from your client devices before the Email Signature Manager server is uninstalled.

If you wish to remove local Outlook signatures deployed by the ESM server, you should ensure the "Remove all signatures other than those specifically deployed" is selected from **Configuration** -> **Deployment Options**.

Following this, please use the **Manage Deployment** option in Email Signature Manager, and remove all deployments from all Users and Groups.  

As the last step, complete a full update cycle using the **Update All** button, this will ensure that all deployed signatures are removed from devices on the next Signagent update cycle.

The agent can also be removed using the information in the following article: [Uninstalling the Email Signature Manager agent programmatically](https://support.symprex.com/en/support/solutions/articles/1000318071-uninstalling-the-email-signature-manager-agent-programmatically).  

If you have already removed Signagent from your devices, you can use the information in the following article to remove all local Outlook signatures: [Managing personal signatures, fonts and stationary for Outlook desktop](https://support.signature365.com/support/solutions/articles/1000319085-managing-personal-signatures-fonts-and-stationary-for-outlook-desktop).
