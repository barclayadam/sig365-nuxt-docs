## Question

Do you store my Microsoft 365 global administrator credentials?

## Answer

No, we do not store your Microsoft 365 Global Administrator credentials. We use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This means we have no access to your credentials. Where you grant access, we store and use access tokens to access Microsoft 365.
