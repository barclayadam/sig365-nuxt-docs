## Question

Do my emails remain private when using Signature 365?

## Answer

Yes, your emails remain entirely private. We do <u>not</u> store or read your emails. The Signature 365 service scans each email for any reply/forward separator, injects the relevant signature in the correct place, and immediately routes the email back to your Microsoft 365 tenant for delivery.
