## Question

Does Signature 365 support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Dynamic Groups?

## Answer

Yes, Signature 365 supports Azure AD Dynamic Groups. You can use Dynamic Groups to create groups with attribute-based memberships and then use these groups in rules in Signature 365.

#### More information

In Azure AD, you can create complex attribute-based rules to enable dynamic memberships for groups. Dynamic group membership reduces the administrative overhead of adding and removing users. You can set up a rule for dynamic membership on security groups or Microsoft 365 groups.

When any attributes of a user change, the system evaluates all dynamic group rules in a directory to see if the change would trigger any group adds or removes. If a user satisfies a rule on a group, they are added as a member of that group. If they no longer satisfy the rule, they are removed. You cannot manually add or remove a member of a dynamic group.

The feature requires an Azure AD Premium license.
