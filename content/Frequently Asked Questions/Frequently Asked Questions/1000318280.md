## Problem

You wish to understand how to create and use a custom field within Signature 365.

## Solution

Custom fields in Signature 365 can be used to create a field for a user that cannot be imported from Microsoft 365.  

This can also be used to allow your staff to update a field within Signature 365 without requiring administrative permissions.

:::info
#### Information

Custom fields cannot be syncronised from Signature 365 to Microsoft 365. Integration is one way from Microsoft 365 to Signature 365
:::

This feature can be used in a number of ways, for example displaying user pronouns or giving staff the option to display a specific field.

To create a new field, log in to Signature 365 and select the **Fields** option from the menu.

The Fields screen lists all imported fields from your Microsoft 365 tenant. The names of these cannot be changed.

The **Token** field will define how you refer to the new field in a signature template, and will be named {{TokenName}}.

The **Type** field defines what type of data can be entered. Options are:

*   Date - a date picker
*   List - a defined list of options that can be chosen from
*   Number - allows only number input
*   Text - a free text field
*   Yes/No

The options below select the type of user that is able to edit this field. Administrators can edit this field using the Signature 365 console.  

Allowing users to edit the field will allow this using the Details tab from the Signature 365 Outlook add-in.
