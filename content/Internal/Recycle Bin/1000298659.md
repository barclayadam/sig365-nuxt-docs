## Problem

When the setup wizard is configuring the Microsoft 365 integration, you get the following error:

*Your Exchange Online environment needs to be configured manually first. You need to run Enable-OrganizationCustomisations.*

This errror appears as shown below:

## Reason

This problem occurs because, in the Microsoft datacenters, certain objects are consolidated to save space. When you use Exchange Online PowerShell or the Exchange admin center to modify one of these objects for the first time, you may encounter an error message that tells you to run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization cmdlet.

For more information, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/enable-organizationcustomization).

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1.  Install the Exchange Online PowerShell module
2.  Connect to Exchange Online
3.  Run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization command

:::info
#### Note

You must connect as a Microsoft 365 Global administrator to complete these steps.
:::

#### Install the Exchange Online PowerShell module

Open Windows PowerShell and run this command as an Administrator:

Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement

#### Connect to Exchange Online

Run this command to connect to Exchange Online:

Connect-ExchangeOnline

#### Run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization command

Run this command:

Enable-OrganizationCustomization

:::warning
You only need to run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization cmdlet once in your Exchange Online organisation. If you attempt to run it again, you will get an error message.

This command may take up to one hour to take effect. After some time has passed, try re-running the setup wizard again.

Note also that some customers have reported this command may fail with an error first time it is run, and then running it a second time, it completes.
