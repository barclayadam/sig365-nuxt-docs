The Azure AD Cloud Sync tool leverages similar properties to update Azure AD attributes with Active Directory content.

By default, the standard ExtensionAttribute details from on-prem AD are synced to the CustomAttribbutes in Exchange online, automatically populating in Signature 365.

The Azure AD Connect tool is able to synchronise additional attributes from AD to Azure AD by creating extended attributes on the Azure domain. This is also possible to set up for Azure AD Cloud Sync, however it is a more complicated process.

Each extended attribute contains the identifier of the Tenant Schema Extension App , and the attribute name from Active directory - for example:  

extension_5fee668838a047eaa990133434e15279_pager or extension_5fee668838a047eaa990133434e15279_ipPhone

These attribute names are standard across all Office 365 Tenants, and how the Signature 365 import process identifies extension attributes in addition to the standard 15

Get-AzureADExtensionProperties lists all properties registered through Azure AD Connect - once these properties are set on a tenant, they can be mapped using the Azure AD Cloud Sync attribute mapping process - selecting the attribute name as the Target Attribute.
