## Solution

You must log in to the Azure portal as a Global Administrator and grant permissions to the add-in for your entire tenant.

This step must only be performed once, and will remove the approval prompt for all users.

Login to the Microsoft [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and manage Azure Active Directory.
