## Scenario

An update has been released to the Signature 365 modern add-in, and you have been advised by Symprex that the Signature 365 modern add-in must be manually updated to take advantage of the improvements it contains.

## Information

Whilst the Outlook modern add-in will in most cases self-update when installed from either the Microsoft 365 integrated apps deployment, or when manually installed using the manifest XML, there are occasions where a major update to the add-in will require a redeployment to allow the update to occur.  

In these situations, information will be sent out from the Symprex social media feeds, or by an email update to customers. There are circumstances where a member of the support team will request that this is completed.

## Solution

The update process will differ depending on how the add-in has been installed for your users.
