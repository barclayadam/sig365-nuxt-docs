## Scenario

You wish to use hotlinked images in your signatures, but Signature 365 defaults to using embedded images.

## Reason

Some Outlook add-ins will treat embedded images as attachments, causing issues when emails are sent.

## Solution

:::warning
!

This may cause recipients of your emails to see hotlinked images as a red X if they do not allow the downloading of external images

:::

Signature 365 offers an option to allow all images to be hotlinked for a customer, and is available by request to the support team.  

This feature will ensure that all images inserted by Signature 365 are hotlinked to a URL, and affects both client and server-side emails.  

Please refer to [Using hotlinked vs embedded images](https://support.signature365.com/support/solutions/articles/1000318637-using-hotlinked-vs-embedded-images-in-outlook) for more information on hotlinking vs embedding.

:::info
To fully implement this solution, you must ensure that Outlook is configured to not embed images. If you are using multiple versions of Outlook you must set the registry key for all versions.  

This can be done by editing the registry in Windows. To do this, follow the steps below.
:::

*   Open regedit
*   Navigate to the following registry key:  

<span dir="ltr" style="background-color: rgb(209, 213, 216);">HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Options\Mail</span>  

Outlook 2016, 2019 and 2021 are all internally referred to as version 16.0
*   Remove or set the following value to 0:  

**Send Pictures With Document**
*   Restart Outlook

When emails are sent with images, they will now be hotlinked referencing the URL location.
