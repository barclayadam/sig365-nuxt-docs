The Signature 365 client-side add-ins are updated on a frequent schedule; current versions of both modern add-in and classic agent are listed below.  

If deployed from using the Get-Addins option from the Microsoft admin centre, the modern add-in is automatically updated by Microsoft.  

If manually deployed via XML, the modern addin will in most cases automatically update but will require manual updating following a manifest version change to implement new features. Information on manifest updates will published by Symprex.  

Information on the manual update process can be found [here](https://support.signature365.com/support/solutions/articles/1000318752-updating-the-signature-365-modern-add-in).
