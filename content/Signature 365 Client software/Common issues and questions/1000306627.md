## Problem

The Outlook add-in has been deployed in the Microsoft 365 Admin center, but it is not being deployed to users as expected.

## Reason

Common reasons for this issue are:

*   It may take up to 6 hours before the add-in is available to all users
*   When deploying to specific groups users in nested groups will not be included

## Solution

The common solutions to this issue are:

*   Allow time for the add-in to be deployed
*   When deploying to specific groups make sure all users are direct members

### Allow time for the add-in to be deployed

Microsoft 365 may take up to 6 hours to deploy the add-in to all users.

### When deploying to specific groups make sure all users are direct members

When deploying to specific groups, Microsoft 365 will only deploy to users that direct members. Users that are members of any nested groups will not be included.

You must either change the memberships of the specific groups you deploy the add-in to or use different groups to deploy the add-in to.
