## Scenario

You wish to insert a signature into emails sent from mobile devices using the Outlook mobile app.

## Solution

The Signature 365 add-in is available for both iOS and android versions of the Outlook Mobile app, and will automatically install if the user has the add-in deployed to the Outlook desktop or web applications.

You will require at least the following version of the Outlook mobile app to use this feature:
<dl class="dl-horizontal"><dt>Outlook for Android</dt><dd>4.2328.3 (42328820) or later</dd><dt>Outlook for iOS</dt><dd>4.2329.0 or later</dd></dl>

Currently, due to limitations by Microsoft, the mobile add-in can only be used to insert the default signature for a user. This happens automatically when a new message is created, and the signature is installed client side on the mobile device.

As the signature is installed on the device, as with Outlook desktop, emails sent from the Outlook mobile app no longer require server-side injection.

You can see if the add-in is enabled on your device by performing the following steps:

*   Open the Outlook app and tap the account icon in the top right.

*   Click the settings gear on the bottom left menu.

*   Select the Add-ins menu option - you may need to scroll the menu items to find this.

*   Scroll the Add-ins menu until you see the Signature 365 item to confirm this is installed. The deployment of the add-in is handled completely by Microsoft - and this cannot be controlled with Signature 365.

All methods of deploying the add-in will install the add-in to all versions of Outlook where supported.
