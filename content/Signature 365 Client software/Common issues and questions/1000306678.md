## Problem

The Signature 365 add-in for Outlook is installed, and configured to add signatures to email, but it is not adding default signatures into email as expected when using Outlook on Windows.

## Reason

Outlook must be version 2104 build 13929.20296 or later for this feature to work.

To see your current version of Outlook, select the **File** menu, then in the backstage select the **Office Account** menu.

The Outlook version is shown in the **About Outlook** section under **Production Information**.

## Solution

Update Outlook to version 2104 build 13929.20296 or later.
