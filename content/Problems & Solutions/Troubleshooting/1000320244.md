## Scenario

You are using Microsoft 365 and wish to disable the built-in signature functionality in New Outlook and OWA.

## Solution

The Exchange admin centre provides the functionality to disable this feature using the **Outlook web app policies** feature within the **Roles** menu option.

The steps below detail how to disable this option for all members of your Microsoft 365 tenant. If you wish to disable this for specific users, you will need to create a new OWA policy and apply these settings.

*   

Log on to the [Exchange admin center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/owapolicies) and select the **Outlook web app policies** option from the menu
