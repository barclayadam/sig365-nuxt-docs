## Problem

You are using Signature 365 server side signatures to send an email to a recipient on your domain but email content such as tasks, contacts and voting buttons are removed from these emails.

## Cause

Outlook utilizes a proprietary Microsoft data format called TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format) to enable Outlook specific features. When sending email outside your domain, its cannot be guaranteed that other mail clients support this format.

To prevent compatibility or display issues in these clients, emails leaving a Microsoft 365 Tenant have these features removed to prevent these issues.

As Signature 365 uses an external connector to inject signatures into your emails, these features are removed when the service is used.

## Solution

To resolve this, you can create a remote domain through the Exchange admin center or using Powershell, and set it to allow TNEF for this domain.

In the **New remote domain** window, name the new remote domain - we suggest "Internal" or similar. The remote domain will be your email domain name.

If you are using additional domains that receive email, they will also need to be added as remote domains in the same manner.

Confirm that the setting has applied and is working by sending an email containing a Task / Contact or similar to an internal recipient.
