## Scenario

You are using server-side injection to insert a signature to your email and wish to insert the signature in a specific location.

## Solution

:::info
#### Information

This method is only available in server-side injection. It cannot be used for client-side signatures, as the signature is inserted as the email is composed.
:::

By default, server-side injection will insert the default signature assigned to a user at the end of the body text of an email that is sent. You can override this behaviour by using a specific tag in an email to specify to the server-side component where you wish the default signature to be inserted.  

The tag will be removed as part of the server-side injection process, ensuring that only the signature is inserted.  

To enable this, simply insert either of the following tags in your email body:  

{{Signature365Signature}}  

[[Signature365Signature]]
