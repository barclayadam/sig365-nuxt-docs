## Scenario

You are using Signature 365 server-side injection with Microsoft Planner, and wish to prevent signatures from being inserted to Planner comment emails.

## Reason

As Microsoft Planner sends an email when a comment is added, this email is routed through server-side signature injection if this is enabled.  

This results in signatures being added to the Planner comments, which can be an undesired behaviour.

## Solution

By adding an Exchange mail flow rule we can prevent signatures from being injected by server-side injection.

*   Log on to the [Exchange admin center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/transportrules)
*   Select Add a rule -> Create a new rule

*   Configure the rule as follows:

    *   Set the name to **[Signature 365] Prevent Planner comments receiving signature injection**
    *   Set **Apply this rule if** to **The message headers** and **matches these text patterns** options to:  

**X-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic** and **PlannerComment**
    *   Set **Do the following** to **Modify the message properties** and **set a message header** to:  

**X-Signature365-MessageProcessed** and **true**
