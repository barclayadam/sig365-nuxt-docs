Create email from Windows Explorer, and default signature is not added.

This is the same for built-in Outlook signatures.

Email is created as plain text.

Open task pane and it is not possible to insert manually either due to being plain text.

Note if server-side is enabled, then if no client-side signatures, a signature will be added server-side after email is sent.
