## PROBLEM

You are using the line-height style in your HTML template, but the line height in Outlook does not match the preview in Signature 365.

## REASON

The line-height style can be specified as a specific unit of measurement (e.g. 14pt, 10px and 2em), as a number that is a multiple of the current font size (e.g. 1.5), or a percentage of the current font size (e.g. 150%).

Different email clients and browsers work on a different baseline,

Outlook requires the line-height to be set in points (pt).

If you have set the line-height in pixels (px), Outlook will convert to points (pt)

## SOLUTION

Specify the line-height style in points (pt) to ensure it shows identical in Signature 365 and all email clients.
