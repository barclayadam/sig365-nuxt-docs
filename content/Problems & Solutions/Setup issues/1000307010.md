## Problem

You are in a hybrid environment and Active Directory attributes for users are not populated in Signature 365.

## Reason

By default, only certain attributes are synchronised from your on-premise Active Directory to Azure AD.

## Solution

Completing the steps below will ensure any additional Active Directory attributes you need in Signature 365 are synchronised from Active Directory to Azure AD, using either Azure AD Connect or Entra Connect cloud sync tools.
<div class="accordion accordion--default" data-identifyelement="517"><div class="accordion__item" data-identifyelement="518"><div class="accordion__item-title" data-identifyelement="519">**Azure AD Connect**</div><div class="accordion__item-content" data-identifyelement="521">

For information about the attributes that are synchronised by default see [Attributes synchronized by Azure AD Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-sync-attributes-synchronized).

You can enable **Directory extension attribute sync** and configure the attributes you wish to synchronise in the Azure AD Connect tool:

1.  Open **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect**
2.  Select **Customise synchronization options** and press **Next**

3.  Enter the credentials of an Azure AD Global Administrator and click **Next**

5.  Domain and OU Filtering will not need to be updated. Click next to proceed to the next step
6.  On the **Optional Features** pane, tick the **Directory extension attribute sync** option and select Next

7.  On the **Directory Extensions** pane, search for your desired attribute in the **Available Attributes** search box  

You may also want to add **extensionAttribute1 (user)** through to **extensionAttribute15 (user)** to **Selected Attributes** in addition to your required attributes

8.  Complete the wizard

By default, the Entra Connect Cloud Sync tool will map all ExtensionAttribute(1-15) values in AD to the CustomAttribute(1-15) fields in Exchange Online.

The tool is also able to map any internal AD attribute to any of the CustomAttribute(1-15) fields.

Signature 365 cannot currently import custom fields created by Entra Connect Cloud Sync tool, any required attributes must be mapped to either of these variable sets.

To do this, you must follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the Entra Connect Sync [portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/DirectoriesADConnectBlade) and click on the **Manage Entra Connect cloud sync** option in the menu

2.  Select your current configuration

3.  Select the **Attribute mapping** menu item and find the AAD attribute that you wish to synchronise to - for example **ExtensionAttribute15**, and click the **Edit** button

4.  You must change the current mapping type to **Direct**, and map to the AD field that you wish to use - for example **ipPhone**

At the next sync, the fields will be populated in Azure AD, and the data will pull through to Signature 365.
